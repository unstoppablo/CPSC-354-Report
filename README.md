# CPSC-354-Report

You can find the overleaf link here: https://www.overleaf.com/project/6168c6959404aa54aedd01cf
I found it to be easier to work on overleaf and track all the changes there and instead only upload each deadline's pdf to github. Now that the project is over, I leave solely the link and the final version.

Hope you enjoy. I definitely did.
